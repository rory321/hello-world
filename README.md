# hello-world


this is the first time i have ever created a file on github so anybody reding this please go easy on me. also this is the first time i have ever tried ubuntu!

i'm looking forward to learning about ubuntu and finding my way around it, it seems a lot more complicated than windows. 

the keyring thing shits me already, so i'm going to be looking how to change that and then the next project i am going to try is to install kodi on ubuntu however after some research last night i did find that there is a kodibuntu OS which i am thinking about just putting on a virtual machine. 

this is fun.
